# po2resizer
 Resize image resolution to power of 2 independently
 
The resizer rescales the dimensions of an image to the power of 2 (independently). It uses a bicubic filter to resample the images.

Works with filetypes: ".jpg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tif"
Currently not working for subfolders. Keep all the images in one folder only.
