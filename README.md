# po2resizer 
The resizer rescales the dimensions of an image to the power of 2 and tries to keep the proportions as well. It uses a Lanczos filter to resample the images.


Works with filetypes: ".jpg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tif"
Currently not working for subfolders. Keep all the images in one folder only.
